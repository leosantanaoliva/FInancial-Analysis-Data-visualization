# Portfolio Project: Exploring 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate Dynamics
## Overview:
This portfolio project focuses on investigating the dynamics of the 10-year breakeven inflation rate, a crucial economic indicator. The project involves utilizing Python to extract data from the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) API and subsequently visualizing the extracted data using Tableau.

## Data Extraction:
For data extraction, Python was employed to interface with the FRED API and retrieve the dataset pertaining to the 10-year breakeven inflation rate. Leveraging Python's extensive libraries and capabilities, a data extraction script was developed to seamlessly fetch the required dataset from the FRED API. This ensured the availability of up-to-date and accurate data for subsequent analysis and visualization.

## Data Visualization:
Upon successful extraction of the dataset, Tableau was utilized to create interactive visualizations that offer a comprehensive exploration of the 10-year breakeven inflation rate dynamics over time. The Tableau visualization provides an intuitive platform for users to interactively analyze trends, patterns, and potential correlations within the dataset, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying economic dynamics.
